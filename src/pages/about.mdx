I'm **M√°rk Tak√°cs**, an AI researcher, consultant, and artist exploring the intersection of **technology, human behavior, and creativity**. My work focuses on **AI agents, behavior modeling, and multi-agent simulations**, with the goal of understanding how AI can **adapt, interact, and evolve**.

I founded <ExternalLink href="https://savalera.com" text="Savalera" />, a small independent lab and consultancy, where I develop AI-driven projects, conduct research, and work on creative experiments that bring together **AI, cognitive science, and art**.

## **Background in AI and Research**

My journey with AI started in **1995**, when I was studying **computer science** and **cognitive science** at university. Even then, my interest wasn‚Äôt just in **building AI systems**, but in using AI to **understand human behavior, personality, and consciousness**.

I spent three years researching various topics with two university friends, developing an AI-powered **intelligent search system (NALBISS). While working on technical advancements, I was already drawn to **applying AI to real-world human-centered problems ‚Äî a theme that still drives my work today.

## **Consulting, Technology, and Teaching**

After university, I chose **industry over academia** and became a **technology consultant**. I joined **Andersen Consulting (later Accenture)** and worked on **large-scale transformation programs**, helping businesses adopt new technologies.

In 2013, I founded **Savalera**, where I continue to work on **AI, digital transformation, and program management**. Over the years, I've published a book on **Docker and containerization**, and delivered corporate training programs on **technology and AI adoption**. Teaching always has been a vital part of my life.

While consulting sharpened my **problem-solving and leadership skills**, I always kept my passion for **AI research and creativity** alive.

## **AI Art and the Human Condition**

In 2023, I took a step back from consulting to explore **AI-driven creativity**. I started working with **AI art, NFTs, and generative models**, using fine-tuned **open-source LLMs** to create **artworks about the human experience** ‚Äî traumas, burnout, identity, memory, and self-reflection.

This work reinforced what I had always believed: **AI is more than just automation.** It can help us **better understand ourselves**.

## **The Agentic Lab: Where AI Meets Human Behavior**

In 2025, I launched the **Savalera Agentic Lab**, a space dedicated to researching **AI agent behavior, personality, and adaptation**.

My goal is to:

- **Develop AI agents that interact and evolve like real collaborators.**
- **Explore AI personality and behavior modeling in multi-agent systems.**
- **Build benchmarks for evaluating AI beyond raw performance.**
- **Use AI simulations to better understand human decision-making.**
- **Create art and experiments that reveal deeper insights into intelligence and creativity.**

This blog is where I share **my research, experiments, and thoughts on AI, art, and technology**. If you‚Äôre interested in these topics, feel free to reach out or follow my work.
