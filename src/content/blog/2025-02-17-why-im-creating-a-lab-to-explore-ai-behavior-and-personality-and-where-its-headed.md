On February 17, we launched the **Agentic Lab** at our family business, [Savalera](https://savalera.com).

This has been an idea on my mind for **30 years now**. That’s a hack of a lot of time. Let me share a personal note on **why I wanna do this** and **where the project is heading**.

---

## **How It All Started**

The idea first came to me in **1995**, when I was studying **computer science** at university. In my third year, I took a subject called **Artificial Intelligence**.

To give some perspective, back then we studied **Lisp as the language of AI**—Python wasn’t mainstream yet. **Neural networks were a separate subject**, related but not fully integrated into AI.

We studied **algorithms, game theory, problem-solving with graphs, NLP, semantic networks**, and more. I was hooked immediately.

But from the start, I had my own idea. I’ve always been drawn to **deep philosophical questions about existence**, and since I first touched a computer at age 12, I knew I wanted to **use computing to explore these questions someday**.

I spent years thinking about:

- **What is consciousness?** Is it innate, learned, or something in between?
- **What’s in a newborn’s mind?** Are we blank slates, or do we come pre-configured?
- **Is the self a defense mechanism?** Is it something that serves us, or does it hold us back?
- **Can we create consciousness artificially?**
- **Can AI help us simulate human development and understand how we work?**

These are **hard questions**, requiring a mix of **philosophy, psychology, medicine, social sciences, spirituality, art and more**.

That’s why I took up **cognitive science** in parallel with AI studies.

Along with two friends, I started my own research. For three years we worked on various topics and in our final thesis we created **NALBISS** (_Natural Language-Based Intelligent Search System_). My friends focused on **search and NLP**, while I worked on **a structured semantic network**—a system that **encoded knowledge about the world** in a way AI could process.

My work was greatly inspired by the [Cyc project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc), which has since been discontinued in 2017.

The university was incredibly supportive. We had **our own lab space**, **access to professors**, and could continue our research throughout multiple semesters.

Our research was a bit controversial. We weren’t focused on **pushing AI methodologies forward**, we wanted to **apply AI to real-world problems**. We were enthusiastically building new stuff while not really advancing science. Besides the core work, I spent many hours talking to my **cognitive science professor**, asking high-level philosophical questions. I still remember him rolling his eyes sometimes.

After graduation, I felt like **many of my core questions were left unanswered**.

A PhD didn’t seem like the right path—universities were more focused on **practical AI advancements**, while I wanted to **explore the more abstract aspect**. Also, my research sponsors and professors didn't really encouraged me to stay, so I decided to **start my professional life** instead.

## **From Consulting to AI Research**

I joined **Andersen Consulting** (which later became **Accenture**) and have been working as a **consultant ever since**. I founded Savalera in 2013.

Helping organizations **adopt new technologies and transform their businesses** became my expertise. I enjoy consulting work a lot. Whatever I do in life I do it with a consultant's mindset.

Teaching has also been a big part of my journey. I’ve taught **Lisp at university**, delivered **corporate training courses** (it's still an active offering of Savalera), and even wrote a book on **Docker and containerization** in 2017.

After finishing a **major transformation program** in late 2022, I decided to **invest more time in creative projects** and return to the questions that kept me awake **30 years ago**.

AI had made immense progress. The **foundational work was done** — I now have a **once-in-a-lifetime opportunity** to apply my ideas in ways that weren't possible before.

I started working with AI models, explored **AI art and NFTs**, and built **creative agents** using fine-tuned open-source models to **generate artworks about the human condition**.

The theme of **human experience, psychology, and self-awareness** comes up a lot in my work. Over the years, I've seen **burnout, stress, anxiety, and depression** firsthand—both in my own life and in those around me. Managing large-scale transformation programs under **high time pressure** has shown me that **understanding the human psyche is my most powerful skillset**.

This realization **deeply influences my art and my AI research**.

The **AI agents I built for art** opened up **new creative frontiers**, and I realized I could bring both my **professional expertise and artistic vision together** by diving deeper into **multi-agent AI research**.

## **Why I Started the Agentic Lab**

In 2025, I decided to **formalize all my ambitions** into the **Agentic Lab at Savalera**.

Here’s what I want to achieve:

- **Develop AI agents with real behavioral depth**; agents that can **adapt, evolve, and interact meaningfully**.
- **Advance AI agent evaluation and benchmarking**, focusing not just on performance but on **behavior and personality**.
- **Run experiments to understand human behavior** using AI simulations to **study decision-making, collaboration, and emotional intelligence**.
- **Create art with deep human meaning**; leveraging **behavioral datasets from my research** to drive artistic exploration.

My plan is to create practical results for people and businesses, I don’t necessarily expect to **solve** the big questions I asked as a student. But I do believe **AI can help us get closer to understanding ourselves**.
